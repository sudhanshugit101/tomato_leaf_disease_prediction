A Tomato leaf disease detection model using CNN and Keras

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/noulam/tomato). It contains 10 classes of tomato leaf diseases. The dataset is divided into 3 folders: train, test and valid. Each folder contains 10 subfolders, each corresponding to a class of tomatoes. The dataset contains 18,440 images in total.
